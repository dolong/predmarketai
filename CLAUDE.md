# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a React + TypeScript application for an AI Automation Dashboard UI focused on predictive markets. The application provides a comprehensive dashboard for managing AI agents, market questions, sources monitoring, and analytics.

## Development Commands

- `npm i` - Install dependencies
- `npm run dev` - Start development server (runs on port 3000, opens browser automatically)
- `npm run build` - Build the production application

## Architecture

### Core Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite 6.3.5
- **UI Library**: Extensive Radix UI components with shadcn/ui
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom gradients and utilities
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Charts**: Recharts
- **Backend Integration**: Supabase (database and server functions)
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form
- **State Management**: React useState (client-side routing via state)
- **Date Handling**: react-day-picker

└── utils/              # Additional utilities
```

### Navigation & Routing
The app uses client-side routing via React state managed in `App.tsx`. The main navigation structure includes:
- **Main**: Overview, Markets, Live Markets, Resolve Markets, Market History, AI Agents
- **Admin**: Reports, Settings
- **Source Settings**: Twitter, News, Telegram, Discord, Reddit

### Key Components

- **AppShell** (`components/layout/AppShell.tsx`): Main layout with sidebar navigation, header with search, and user dropdown
- **Pages**: Each page is a separate component that receives `onNavigate` props for navigation
- **UI Components**: Comprehensive set of Radix UI components in `components/ui/`

### Data Types

The application works with several core types defined in `lib/types.ts`:
- **Question**: Market questions with states, resolution criteria, sources
- **Agent**: AI agents with various source types and execution frequencies
- **Source**: Data sources (Twitter, news, etc.) with trust levels
- **Answer**: User responses to questions
- **ConnectorHealth**: Status monitoring for data connectors

### Theming & Styling

- Uses Tailwind CSS with custom gradient utilities
- Custom CSS classes like `gradient-primary` for consistent styling
- Responsive design with mobile support via `use-mobile.ts` hook
- Toronto timezone formatting for dates

### Supabase Integration

- Server functions in `supabase/functions/`
- KV store implementation for data persistence
- Database integration via `@jsr/supabase__supabase-js`

## Development Notes

- Components follow shadcn/ui patterns with Radix UI primitives
- State management is primarily handled through React useState
- The app uses Vite's path aliasing with `@/` pointing to `src/`
- Date formatting defaults to America/Toronto timezone
- No test suite is currently configured
- Development server runs on port 3000 with auto-opening browser
